- there is no absolute standard of rest.
- this means we cant determine if two events at t1, t2 occurred at the same position in space.
- newton believed in absolute time

- light travels at a finite speed (wrt to what? ether?)
- different observers, moving through ether, would measure the speed of light 
  differently, but light speed relative to the ether is fixed.

- ether is unnecessary if we abandon the requirement for absolute time
- all observers should measure the same speed of light, regardless of how fast
  they are traveling
