# function types

- set of morphisms (hom-set)
- product of two objects z, a connected to b by morphism g

- being a morphism of product is close to being a function of 2 variables

- exponents (exactly iterated product)

- cartesian closed contains
  - terminal object
  - product of any pair of objects
  - exponential for any pair of objects
  -~ supports products of arbitrary arity
  - models for lambda calc
  - cartesian closed category that also supports initial object and coproduct is bicartesian closed

- function types are exponentials

- exponentials of sums
- function from a sum of 2 types is equivalent to a pair of functions from individual types

- exponentials of exponentials, currying expressed in terms of exponentials

- void type = false, unit type = true

- function type corresponds to logical implication

- eval ~~ modus ponens

- the meaning of the absurd function is ex falso quodlibet
