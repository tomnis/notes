# free monoids

- start with set of 2 elements `{a, b}`
- add all the products
- natural numbers with multiplication is not a free monoid ?? because we reduce to form a single element?
- eg we need to use concat as the multiply

- monoid homomorphism must preserve the monoidal structure
- h (a * b) = h a * h b
- must map unit to unit

- every object in Mon (the category of monoids) cat be trivially mapped to a set (of its elements), the underlying set.


- universal construction of free monoid
p :: x -> U m
- maps a set of generators x to the generators inside the "xray" image of M
- U is the forgetful functor (maps Mon to Set)

- any monoid with generators x can be obtained from the free monoid based on x


2) empty list is mapped to 1
[1,2,3,4] maps to 24
countably infinitely many lists map to 12, you can always append another 1
