- all set-valued functors can be obtained from hom-functors through natural transformations
- hom-functors:
	-  maps any x in C to the set of morphisms C(a, x) (for fixed a)
	-  maps morphism f: x -> y to C(a, f)


- functors we have:
	- hom-functor
	- arbitrary set-valued functor F

- components of alpha are regular functions between sets
	- alpha_x :: C(a, x) -> F x

- naturality square for alpha (the natural transformation)
	- alpha_y . C(a, f) = F f . alpha_x 
- every point in C(a, x) is a morphism h from a -> x
	- alpha_y (C(a, f) h) = (F f)(alpha_x h)
	
- action of homfunctor on a morphism is defined as precomposition
	- C(a, f)h = f . h

- so we have:
	- alpha_y (f . h) = (F f)(alpha_x h)

- specialize x = a
	- alpha_y f = (F f)(alpha_a id_a)

- left hand side is totally determined by value of alpha_a at id_a
- we can pick any such value and it will generate a natural transformation
- conversely, given a natural transformation alpha from C(a, -) to F,
  we can evaluate it at id_a to get a point in F a
- there is a 1:1 correspondence between natural transformations from C(a,-) to F and elements of F a
- Nat(C(a, -), F) ~~= F a

- the whole natural transformation crystallizes from one nucleation site
