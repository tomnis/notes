# natural transformations

- functors are mappings between categories that preserve structure
- a functor embeds one category in another

- special mappings of functors
- selection of morphisms
- naturality condition: G f . a_a = a_b . F f

- haskell, polymorphic function must be defined uniformly for all types

- headOption is a natural transformation?
- works for any type a with no limitations (parametric polymorphism)

- fmap f . safehead = safehead . fmap f

- function types are contravariant in the argument type
