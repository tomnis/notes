# representable functors

## the hom functor
- pick arbitrary a, x in C. hom-set C(a, x) is an object in Set.
- we can obtain a mapping from x to Set by varying x and keeping a constant C(a, -)

- can also extend this mapping to morphisms.
- let f in C be a morphism between arbitrary x and y.
- x => C(a, x)
- y => C(a, y)
- then f is mapped to a function from C(a, x) to C(a, y)
- pick an arbitrary h in C(a, x)
- f . h :: a -> y
- C(a, f)h = f . h
- Reader functor

- what if we fix the target of the homset instead of the source?
- is C(-, a) a functor? (yes, contravariant)

- letting both objects vary gives us a profunctor
- C(-, =)

## representable functors
- for every choice of a in C, we get a functor from C to Set
- structure-preserving mapping to Set is a representation

- for functor F to be representable:
    - there is an a in C
    - there is a natural transformation alpha from C(a, -) to F
    - there is a natural transformation beta in the other direction
    - a . b must be the identity natural transformation

- representable functor is something like a container for memoizing function calls

- tabulate, index
