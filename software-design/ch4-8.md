## modules should be deep

- what do you think of int flags?

- is linked list shallow?
- maybe in java, what about in a functional language?

- addNullValue is a good shallow example

- method length limit

- make the common case simple (think about sane defaults)


## information hiding

- dependencies still exist even if they are hidden
- temporal decomposition leads to information leakage


## general purpose modules

- building an isomorphism with ui features isnt always best
- beware of false abstractions
- pass through methods


## pull complexity downwards

- defaults for config parameters
