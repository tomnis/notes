- LTP (long term potentiation), temporarily strengthen synapses (what does this mean for neural nets? overfitting?)
- neural stem cells in the adult brain

- functional plasticity:
  - physiological aspects of nerve cell function
  - impulse frequency, p(release chem signal)

- structural plasticity:
  - volumetric changes, new pathways, new cells
